*A few stubs on mental health.*

Even if you've tried and failed at something (eg. a test or interview), you're
still more or less the same person as before as far as skills are concerned.
Don't hate yourself because of individual or isolated events.

If you're dissatisfied by a long-term trend, try to change it through daily
effort. Something like Atomic Habits.

If you genuinely hate your very identity, you might need therapy.
Here are a few lines of thought:

1) The set of human beings isn't ordered. You can't put a number above each
person's head that says "this person ranked X in the world".
2) Identity itself is a pretty flawed construction. Like, oftentimes the
categories of who *you think you are*, *who you really are*, and *what you do*
is a tangled mess. Especially, the friction between the first and latter two
cause anguish (take a look at Neurosis and Human Growth).

What is "your best"? What does it mean to do your best? Generally, establishing
some effort-based metric is more helpful than purely focusing on outcome.

## Open questions

What is passion, really? How to like things? What does it even mean to be
interested?
  The best replacement I've been able to come up with is time and effort
  allocation. If I'm able to spend time on it, does it really matter whether
  I'm passionate or not.

Unfortunately achievement doesn't actually fix self-esteem. In fact, it might
make impostor syndrome worse. The idea/identity of being "good" or "smart"
seems to be a moving goalpoast :(
  I believe this comes down to process vs outcome. Always focus on process.

Coming to terms with being... mid? If we are not the best, what are we?
  Yeah this one's pretty tough.

> Anything worth doing is worth overdoing / doing poorly.

## Neovim
I would just like to talk to whoever thought Neovim's configuration system was 
a good idea. I guess everyone who uses it agree that hundreds to thousands of
lines of Lua is a good way to configure a text editor.
