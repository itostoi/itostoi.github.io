Hi, I'm Derek. I learn, write code, try to have fun, and sleep.

UCLA Class of 2025, BS in Computer Science and Mathematics.

I have mostly written C++ and Python.

My CS-related activities are primarily ML, Linux, and some game development,
mostly with Unity. I hesitate to say I am "good" at any of these, but rather I
do my best to spend time on them.
